        <h1>Know Major Things about us to Become a Millionaire (Read Carefully)</h1>

        <ul>
            <li><span>1.</span> Limited token supply, 100% available for the community.</li>
            <li><span>2.</span> The amount you spend to join the community will be used for locked liquidity that is reserved and cannot be redeemed to dump the price.</li>
            <li><span>3.</span> The amount involved in trading liquidity will be used for trading, and only that amount is redeemable.</li>
            <li><span>4.</span> As the locked + trading liquidity supply increases in the contract, the price of the token also increases.</li>
            <li><span>5.</span> You will be paid up to 7 levels, meaning if you refer someone, and that person refers someone else, and so on up to the 7th referral level, you will be paid because you initiated a "Butterfly Impact."</li>
            <li><span>6.</span> For each referral, you will be paid in BNB, which will be directly transferred to your linked wallet.</li>
            <li><span>7.</span> At the point when we realize we are big enough to eat all "shit coins," I will burn all remaining token supply of Freedy, reducing it to thousands and pumping the token price to anywhere from x2 to x100,000.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How to Become a Millionaire</h2>

        <ul>
            <li><span>1.</span> Join the community and receive some Freedy tokens that will be locked until the bonding curve to avoid pump-and-dump scenarios. (Think sensibly—if you get some tokens, can that alone make you a millionaire even though they are locked? I think not.)</li>
            <li><span>2.</span> By joining the community, you will be eligible for trading. The traded tokens are 100% usable and have no lock conditions. This means the earlier you buy and hold tokens, the more their value will increase as the community grows. You can book profits whenever you want. (Some OGs might think about trading tokens directly— F### Off those OGs! As Only those who join the community in Step 1 will be whitelisted for pre-trading of tokens. We don't want any OGs taking advantage of our community.)
<br><br>
<b>Calculation:</b> " In the beginning, the market cap is 5K. If it reaches only 100K, it means the token price has pumped to x20. If you purchased it for $10, it would turn into $200. But if the market cap becomes 1 billion, then it’s x200, which means $2,000. If the market cap becomes 1 billion and it’s x20,000, it means you’ve made $200K. If the market cap is $12, calculate it yourself. There are variations depending on the market cap at which you entered, when you exited, and how much you invested."
</li>
            <li><span>3.</span> For each referral you make, you will be paid varying amounts for each level, ranging from $0.35 to $1.

<br><br>
<b>Calculation:</b> " Now, if you make just 10 referrals, and each of those 10 people brings in 10 referrals, and so on for 7 levels, you initiate a Butterfly Chain of 10*10*10*10*10*10*10 = 10 million people. If the average payment for each referral is $0.35 in worst scenario, you earn $3.5 million! This is just an average—the actual amount could vary or be even higher based on your dedication to the cult community."</li>
        </ul>
